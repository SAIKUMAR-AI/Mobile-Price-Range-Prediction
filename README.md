# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
In today's world, smartphones have become an essential part of our daily lives. With the increasing demand for smartphones, there are a lot of options available in the market with various price ranges. To help customers in making informed decisions, it is essential to predict the price range of the smartphone based on its features. In this project, we aim to predict the price range of smartphones using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
The problem we are trying to solve is to predict the price range of smartphones based on their features such as battery power, camera quality, RAM, etc. With the increasing demand for smartphones, it has become crucial to make informed decisions before purchasing a smartphone. Our goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the price range of a smartphone based on its features.
In this project, we aim to predict the price range of smartphones using machine learning algorithms. We will be using a dataset containing information about various smartphones, including features such as battery power, camera quality, RAM, etc. We will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature selection to prepare the data for model implementation.
